	<h2>The Fine Print:</h2>
	<h3>Terms &amp; Conditions</h3>
	<p><b>Terminology:</b> "We", "Us", and "Our" refer solely to Michael Pratt, but using plural sounds better in legalese. "Site" refers to collage.fritbot.com. That's where you are right now, in case it wasn't obvious.</p>
	<p><b>Use of the site:</b> Usage of this site implies you are at least 18 years old or have your parents' permission - there are bad words here and your sensitive little eyes may be irreparably damaged by your parents inability to control your browsing habits. You also agree that you use this site at your own risk. We make every attempt to keep out content that is not safe for work or otherwise overly undesirable; however, we accept no responsibility if you are offended by or otherwise experience negative consequences related to your use of the site. This includes but is not limited to being fired, loss of productivity, spontaneous uncontrollable laughter, or getting caught in alternate dimensions.</p>
	<p><b>Submission of images:</b> When you submit an image URL and/or album, you acknowledge that you do so of your own volition and under no expectation of payment. You acknowledge that we have no requirement to add your submission to our image harvest - images will be moderated to weed out offensive and boring images. You agree to not submit any images with pornography, gore, or things that are just really not funny. Repeated violations of this rule may result in suspension of your ability to submit images with no notice or warning.</p>
	<p><b>Content of images on this site:</b> We make every attempt to filter out overly offensive images, images that contain obviously copyrighted content, or malicious code such as viruses, etc. However, no images are actually hosted by this site so we make no guarentee of their content. Continued use of this site acknowledges that your browser may be directed to show wonderous places filled with amusement and hilarity, or offense and danger, and you release us from responsibility for what you may find (or what may find you) out there. However, if you do wish to report an image as overly offensive, malicious, or infringing copyright, please email me at <a href="mailto:urthen@fritbot.com" target="_blank">urthen@fritbot.com</a> and include the exact URL to the image(s) in question, and we will take the matter under consideration.
	<p><b>Jurisdiction:</b> This website is operated under and is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the laws of Texas and the United States. You also acknowledge that if you wish to sue me, an independent creator simply seeking to make something cool and put it on the internet, you are probably overreacting and should just leave the site and cool down for a while. Go read a book or something - preferably not anything by Ayn Rand.</p>
	<p>If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. If for any reason you find any of these terms and conditions disagreeable or overly childish, you immediately relinquish any further right to use this site and are politely requested to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=10&hl=en&safe=active&site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&q=crying+baby">leave</a>.</p>
	<h3>Privacy</h3>
	<p>We collect a small amount of personal information when you connect with our site using Facebook or Twitter. This information includes your profile avatar and name, which may be displayed on parts of our site (leaderboards, etc) without your notice. Additionally, we (or third parties such as Facebook or Twitter) will place cookies on your computer as part of the normal operation of this site. If you do not consent to this information being stored, collected, and displayed, do not connect with this site. You may still utilize the full functionality of the collager, but will not be able to submit your own content without connecting.</p>
	<p>That said, we will never contact you, post to your wall, or sell/give away your personal information. We only want this information for the purposes of making a more awesome site.<p>
